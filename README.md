# Protocol Proxy
Manually controlled proxy for exploring/debugging TCP protocols

**Early WIP**

I am planning to make it a TUI-controlled interactive TCP proxy, which would
allow the user to explore, filter, replace, log, search, etc. etc. packages sent
from/to the client, and view them both as a hexdump, as a string, and as a
combination of both

Any help is appreciated!
